Just Enough Piglin Bartering!

![In Action](https://github.com/tnkmods/JEPB/blob/main/art/screenshot.png)

See everything that Piglin will give you when you hand them a gold ingot. Items returned by the Piglin will show up as available recipes for the item (for instance, Blackstone), and showing the usages of a gold ingot will show *all* piglin bartering trades.
